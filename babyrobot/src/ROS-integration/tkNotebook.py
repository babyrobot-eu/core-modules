"""
    Defines a Notebook class to be used with Tkinter. A Notebook instance
    has the attributes change_tab, add_tab, destroy_tab, and focus_on.

    change_tab:  Internal Function, I don't suggest you call this directly.
    add_tab:     Creates a tab
    destroy_tab: destroys the given tab
    focus_on:    Focuses on the given tab

    The __init__ function creates three frames. One to hold the tabs together,
    one to create the base to parent each tab's children, and one to hold the
    base frame and the tab frame together.

    Each tab is a Label with a default relief of "GROOVE". Each label uses
    event bindings so that change_tab is called with the tab's ID Number as
    an argument. Each tab relief, when selected is set by default to "RAISED"
    
    For an exampe, view the source code, and run the module.
