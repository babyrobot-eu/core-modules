tell you a little bit about it  Promotion It's called I think have you ever heard of ethics will on the effects are but not in relation to and see no ethics even the HI out API is saying something else in the mail  And I don't really pay attention  All right but what I think the idea that every one hundred fifty of our new release movies you also get you get some of the Mossad bring in Jane I think you have five tingles But our main variety of maybe their own argument  Brian with our demand all of our maybes are free there's no rental charge or anything that I form it is completely free  Well now I thought I'll miss my on demand that I had what I am saying let me tell you what I thought some of them were free and some of them worked  I didn't but I meant if you think the movie package  If you go to HBO hundred may end Grammy paying passage dollars to watch you maybe only demand right  You know lies ahead but then they began ethics are completely free most of our maybes on a demand are than a relay since we do have a lot of old Navy does well with our customers happy because we don't have to not like the older movies and some that like to me or maybe  We have a wide variety you also have with this at have to waste stream and extract to your computer or any device in your house that is take a poll of accessing Wipha  As far as movies so you'll know what weight is if we're going to want to Lavie it will be on TV or on on our TV Yes we don't want to over the computer or  This is just an option package I don't have to use the  It's an option we do like to tell our customers about I don't like getting more attractive  Pics and I'm so well that we need more yes some people like that but there's a lot that can like oh you know  What we tell it to all of them but the party guys if I started I thought this package is completely free  There's no contract to keep it or obligation says he didn't want to keep the past thirty days you can either call us back or you can also go moment here you are sticking around in canceling and it would cost you nothing but if you gave want to keep it it would be eight dollars a month  OK  You know I tell you now we would probably because when you play this white till it comes out as easily about a year later and that's not to long for us we've been around so long anyway but at the  Way I have an exciting I've signed it slip into the channels  I haven't Chaz it because I really you know I'm in the twenty first century but not with the state  If that makes since the a lot of the and  That's what draw Fring is a
