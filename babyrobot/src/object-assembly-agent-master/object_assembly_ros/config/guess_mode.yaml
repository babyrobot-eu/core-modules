# type of symmetry that characterizes each object. Used to check multiple
# possible configurations. Can be "none", "cubic", "cylindrical" (TODO), spherical (TODO).
# Note that the meshes used to estimate the object poses must have their
# origin set correctly for this to work. Parts with cubic or spherical symmetry
# must have their origin at the center of the mesh. Parts with cylindrical symmetry
# must have their origin on the central axis and the central axis must align with the z axis of it's coordinate frame00.
